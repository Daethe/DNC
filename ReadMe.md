# Domain Name Creator

This tool was made for people who no longer want to edit the Apache files to create a new domain name as part of their development. This is only available for Linux. Make sure to execute the following commands:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python2.7
```

#### Multilingual application

For now this application supports two languages.
- English
- French

With the addition of a new language file, please make sure to write the name of the language file to create within the file (__data/lang.dnc__) to ensure access to it within application.
